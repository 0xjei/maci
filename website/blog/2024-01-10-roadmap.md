Greetings anons,

Happy 2024 and welcome to the new MACI documentation website and blog! Moving forward, we‚Äôll post here with our latest project news and development updates.

We have a few exciting announcements to share, but first a quick review:

## MACI Overview

### WTF is MACI?

**Minimal Anti-Collusion Infrastructure (MACI) is an on-chain voting platform which protects privacy and minimizes the risk of collusion and bribery.**

MACI is a set of smart contracts and zero-knowledge circuits upon which which developers can build applications, such as voting systems or quadratic funding platforms. It was originally [proposed by Vitalik Buterin](https://ethresear.ch/t/minimal-anti-collusion-infrastructure/5413) in 2019, then implemented and maintained by community members with support from the [Ethereum Foundation](https://ethereum.foundation/). It's now actively maintained within [Privacy & Scaling Explorations (PSE)](https://pse.dev/).

For a general overview, brief history, and context on the importance of MACI, see the [Release Announcement: MACI 1.0](/blog/maci-1-0-release) by Wei Jie, one of the creators. He also created a helpful [overview of MACI video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKuNj_IQVYI). Kyle Charbonnet wrote a great [Technical Introduction to MACI 1.0](/blog/maci-1-0-technical-introduction) that provides a walkthrough on how MACI operates. I also recently presented an [introduction to MACI](https://app.streameth.org/zuzalu/zuconnect_hackathon/session/maci_workshop) at Devconnect.

### MACI Vision

MACI is a public good that is quickly becoming a core piece of infrastructure for Ethereum-based applications to support on-chain voting while protecting user privacy. Using MACI, no voter can prove how they voted yet voting results are published publicly and verified with cryptographic proofs to prevent censorship, bribery, collusion, and other nefarious acts common in public polling processes.

**Our MACI team‚Äôs vision is to build the most secure e-voting solution in the world.**

Let's hop into our updates to see how we plan to execute on this bold vision.

## Project updates

New year, new team, new roadmap!

### 1) New team

Over the past few months we've undergone lot of change within the MACI core team. I'd like to take this chance to introduce and welcome our new core members!

MACI is now maintained and will be continuously improved by our core team:

- [ctrlc03](https://github.com/ctrlc03)
- [Sam Richards](https://x.com/samonchain)
- [0xmad](https://github.com/0xmad)
- [kittybest](https://github.com/kittybest)
- [crisgarner](https://github.com/crisgarner)
- [aguzmant103](https://github.com/aguzmant103)
- Vee

Great time to mention that **we stand on the shoulders of giants**. Many gigabrains have made heroic advancements in this project. Major thanks to all those who have contributed to date! Too many people to list here, but calling out a few notable players:

- Vitalik, Barry, Wei Jei for the original idea, architecture, initial implementation, and ongoing guidance
- Folks from our most recent team that launched our [v1.1.1 release](/blog/maci-v1-1-1-release) and have since moved on: Q, Jei, Chao, and Daehyun

We're excited to carry the baton forward to bring the MACI vision into reality!

### 2) New roadmap

As a new team working in open source, we're taking a concerted effort to make our work more accessible and to foster more collaboration from our open source community. As part of this work, we're making our team roadmap public and will continue to do so.

[Read our full roadmap here](/roadmap).

The TL;DR is that we'll be focusing most of our time on:

1. **Developer experience** (documentation, tooling) so that MACI is easier for projects to integrate
2. **Community engagement** (integration support, hackathon bounties, conference presentations) to more quickly iterate and improve based off feedback
3. [**Quadratic Funding Experiments**](https://qf.pse.dev/) to support real-world adoption of this technology

### 3) New documentation

MACI now has a fresh new website, with [revamped documentation](/docs/introduction)!

Our team quickly saw the need for improved educational content about MACI. It's a complex project with several core components (ZK circuits, Ethereum smart contracts, TypeScript libraries). Whether you're a developer looking to integrate MACI into your application or an open-source developer interested in contributing, we want to improve your onboarding experience.

[Please take a look and let us know what you think](/docs/introduction).

### 4) New community access

Wether you're interested in contributing to MACI or merely want to follow along with developments, we're making that much easier. Here's some ways you can keep in touch:

- [GitHub](https://github.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/maci): open an issue or PR or [join our active discussions](https://github.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/maci/discussions)
- [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/sF5CT5rzrR): join the [PSE server](https://discord.com/invite/sF5CT5rzrR) and hop into the `#üó≥Ô∏è-maci`¬†channel to chat with our core team
- [Twitter/X](https://twitter.com/zkmaci): follow our new handle [@zkMACI](https://twitter.com/zkmaci) for updates and hit us up with feedback
- This website: we'll continue to post updates here (at least 1 blog post every quarter)!

Expect to see announcements around new MACI releases, integrations, relevant events (quadratic funding rounds, conferences, hackathons), and grant RFPs.

We look forward to working more closely with our open source community!

## How‚Äôs that sound?

Questions? Concerns? Ideas? We‚Äôd love to hear from you!

If there's a feature you think we should work on or an initiative you'd like to collaborate with us on, please let us know! We welcome input from anyone in the community.

Feel free to [hit us up on X](https://twitter.com/zkmaci) or reach out to our team in the¬†[PSE Discord](https://discord.com/invite/sF5CT5rzrR)¬†(`#üó≥Ô∏è-maci`¬†channel).

Onward and upward.
